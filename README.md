# Project Description
The Library Trivia Guessing Game is a data analytics project that explores facts from the Seattle Public Library's checkout data. Learn facts about books, authors, publishers and the types of media checked out in Seattle.

This game is a collaborative project by Yong Liang and Ellen Hatleberg. It's purpose is to utilize concepts learned during Module 1 of Flatiron School's Coding Bootcamp. For this data analytics project, ActiveRecord was used to access a Sqlite3 Database. The database was seeded using data collected from the Checkouts by Title API of the Seattle Public Library data available from https://data.seattle.gov.

The project includes three models: Author, Publisher and Book. The Book is the join model. A publisher has many authors through books and vice versa. A command line interface (CLI) is provided for users to play the game, input their answers to questions and see question solutions.
